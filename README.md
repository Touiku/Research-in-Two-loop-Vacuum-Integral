# Research-in-Two-loop-Vacuum-Integral
Scattering amplitudes at loop level can be expressed in terms of Feynman integrals. The latter
satisfy partial differential equations in the kinematic variables. Taking the two-loop vacuum bubble
as an example, we analyzed its dynamical properties. In addition, we utilized the method of
Integration-By-Parts (IBP) to demonstrate that any higher-order loop integrals can be linearly
expressed in terms of several master integrals finitely. By designing parameters x and y related to
the mass ratio of virtual particles, we found virtual differential equations satisfied by the master
integrals and solved the differential properties of hypergeometric functions 2F1 for the case of one
variable x as well as Apellâ€™s hypergeometric functions F4 for the case of two variable x and y. In
comparison with previous works regarding the calculation of two-loop integrals, we not only give
the analytical results but promote a novel mathematical prospect of Feynman integrals, which will
be proved to lead a profound foundation in future research.
